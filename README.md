## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

#### i improved imsersly on:
-the use of structured html semantics
-different screen responsiveness
-nav menu hide and display
-use of flex and grid where approriate
-and the use of the addEventListener, in JavaScript

See some code snippets below:

```html
 <button id="menu-close"><i class="fa-solid fa-xmark fa-3x"></i></button>
```
```css
 #navigation{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    position: absolute;
    font-weight: 800;
    height: 100vh;
    width: 70%;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    display: none;
    background: white;
    padding: 12rem 3rem 0 3rem;
  }
```
```js
 menuClose.addEventListener('click', () => {
      navigation.style.display = 'none';
    });
}
```
### Continued development

#### Am enthusiastic in building bigger projects with reponsiveness, and correct semantic structure with other programming languages.

### Useful resources

- [resource](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home)) - This helped me for developing my front-end skills. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
